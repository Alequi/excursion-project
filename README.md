# Hiking App - Practice Website

This is a basic static website created using **HTML** and **CSS** to simulate the landing page of a future hiking mobile app.

The goal of this project is to **practice version control using Git** during the development process.

## 🔍 About the Project

The website includes:

- 🎥 An embedded video presentation
- 🔗 Placeholder links for future app downloads (Android & iOS)
- 🌐 Simple layout styled with pure CSS

This is not a fully functional application — just a **front-end practice project** for educational purposes.

## 📁 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as part of my learning process to:

- Understand the basic structure of a web project
- Practice version control with Git and GitHub
- Explore how to embed media and create external links

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alequi/excursion-project.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📦 Future Plans

   - Add responsive design
   - Include real download links
   - Improve accessibility and UX


🧭 Made with curiosity and a love for hiking!
